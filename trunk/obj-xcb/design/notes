Code-generation from xml files
------------------------------

Getting xid's and requests from xml files
	-xcb_types.h
		-rip out xid's and make objects for them
	-xproto.xml
		-take requests and group them by first field type that 
		is also an xid class. For example, the CreateWindow class would
		be in ObjXCBWindow, as the first field type isn't an xid, but
		the second is. For a request like GetGeometry, it should be in
		the class that is highest in the hierarchy.  Drawable, while
		not an xid, will be treated as a "superclass" for windows and
		pixmaps, therefore, GetGeometry will go in ObjXCBDrawable and
		then be available to ObjXCBWindow through inheritance.

Also need to follow the rules for prefixing XCB in from of requests so that
CreateWindow can be correctly called in the method as XCBCreateWindow, not just
CreateWindow.

NOTE
----
Bindings to XCBConnection, etc. are going to be hand-written b/c they are not described in xml only core X requests, etc. are in xml
