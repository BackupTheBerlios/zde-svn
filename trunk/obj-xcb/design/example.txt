Go through xcb_types.h
----------------------
-Ignore struct's
-First XID is named WINDOW, create files ObjXCBWindow.m and ObjXCBWindow.h (putting all into one file would be easier for starters)
-Same for XIDs PIXMAP,CURSOR,FONT,GCONTEXT,COLORMAP,ATOM
-See union named DRAWABLE, special case that is parent of field types WINDOW and PIXMAP
-FONTABLE todo
-Ignore structs

Go through xproto.xml
---------------------
-Store all enums in internal representation for possible later use(?)(XML::Twig does this for us)
-Request named CreateWindow
	-Parse name, see the word "Create", so it should be a constructor
	-Every request's first implied "field" when translated to XCB is an XCBConnection
	-Go through field types, first one that is an XID is wid, so this request goes into ObjXCBWindow
		-if there are no field types, becomes static method of first XID in its reply field.
		-no XID in reply fields, I dunno :( maybe a static function in ObjXCBConnection, but there would have to be some way of inserting
		that dynamically generated code into the only static object. hmm...
	-valueparam
		-value-mask-type is data type for value-mask-name(actual mask) and value-list-name(is a pointer to values)
	-reply
		-prescence indicates that we will be returning a *pointer* to a XCBGet"RequestName"Rep, and that the XCB function must be called like
		return XCBGetRequestNameReply(c,XCBRequestName(c,field1,field2,...));
		-not so concerned about what the reply fields are.
		-I don't think that creating new objects to encapsulate replies is appropriate, structures are good.
	-list
		-always represents a pointer, or in other words, an array.
	
-General case
	-Name has Create, constructor (InternAtom is special case constructor for ObjXCBAtom)
	-Name has Get, returns a reply of form XCB*Reply, ex. XCBGetWindowAttributesReply for a request named GetWindowAttributes
	-Some cases like GrabPointer and GrabButton would, following the above rules, go into ObjXCBWindow, but that probably isn't
	where they should be... Something such as TranslateCoordinates might make sense, though...
	-Others I haven't seen yet
	

Output in order of xid processing, then constructor/Create - regular requests - free

There are some requests, like ConfigureWindow, that could be better objectified if the valueparam fields were abstracted away, but I 
don't know how to do this accuratly.  For example, the possible values for value_mask are in the enum ConfigWindow, but there is no way
of relating that back to ConfigureWindow that I can see.  This might be too high-level for a language binding anyway. 

Once these problems are sorted, this should cover every case I have come across by looking through the xml files.
