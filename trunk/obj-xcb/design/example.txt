Go through xcb_types.h
----------------------
-Ignore struct's
-First XID is named WINDOW, create files ObjXCBWindow.m and ObjXCBWindow.h (putting all into one file would be easier for starters)
-Same for XIDs PIXMAP,CURSOR,FONT,GCONTEXT,COLORMAP,ATOM
-See union named DRAWABLE, special case that is parent of field types WINDOW and PIXMAP
-FONTABLE todo
-Ignore structs

Go through xproto.xml
---------------------
-Store all enums in internal representation for possible later use(?)(XML::Twig does this for us)
-Request named CreateWindow
	-Every request's first implied "field" when translated to XCB is an XCBConnection
	-Go through field types, first one that is an XID is wid, so this request goes into ObjXCBWindow
		-if there are no field types, becomes method of ObjXCBConnection
	-valueparam
		-value-mask-type is data type for value-mask-name(actual mask) and value-list-name(is a pointer to values)
	-reply
		-prescence indicates that we will be creating a new Object that encapsulates the reply and makes the fields available as accessor functions,
		and only calls XCB*Reply when an accessor method is called, as per Jamey's suggestion.
	-list
		-usually represents a pointer, although it can be considered something more of a list:) NOTE:Read XCB's iterator code.
	
-General case
	-Name has Get, returns a reply Object with accessor methods to the reply fields. 
	-Some cases like GrabPointer and GrabButton would, following the above rules, go into ObjXCBWindow, but that probably isn't
	where they should be... Something such as TranslateCoordinates might make sense, though...
	-Others I haven't seen yet
	

Output in order of xid processing, then constructor - regular requests - free

There are some requests, like ConfigureWindow, that could be better objectified if the valueparam fields were abstracted away, but I 
don't know how to do this accuratly.  For example, the possible values for value_mask are in the enum ConfigWindow, but there is no way
of relating that back to ConfigureWindow that I can see.  This might be too high-level for a language binding anyway. 

Once these problems are sorted, this should cover every case I have come across by looking through the xml files.
