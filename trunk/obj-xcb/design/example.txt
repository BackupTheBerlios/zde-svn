/* first pass */

Go through xcb_types.h
----------------------
-Ignore struct's
-First XID is named WINDOW, create files ObjXCBWindow.m and ObjXCBWindow.h
-Same for XIDs PIXMAP,CURSOR,FONT,GCONTEXT,COLORMAP,ATOM
-See union named DRAWABLE, special case that is parent of field types WINDOW and PIXMAP
-FONTABLE todo
-Ignore structs

Go through xproto.xml
---------------------
-Ignore enums, events, eventcopy,error
-Request named CreateWindow
	-Parse name, see the word "Create", so it should be a constructor
	-Every request's first implied "field" when translated to XCB is an ObjXCBConnection
	-Go through field types, first one that is an XID is wid, so this request goes into ObjXCBWindow
	-Ignore valueparam
	


Output in order of xid processing, then constructor/Create - regular requests - free
