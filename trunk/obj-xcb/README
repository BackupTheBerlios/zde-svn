Objective-C XCB bindings and test suite. I am hoping to have this project accepted to the Google SoC so that I don't have to get a "real" job instead, and continue working on a cool project.  Either way, this will eventually be used in ZDE as the backend for zwl and zimwm when it is in a useable state.  Hopefully, it will also be useful for other projects.

The scope of the bindings is intended to not just cover XCB but extensions as well, such as XCBrender, although the core XCB bindings will be the main focus.
