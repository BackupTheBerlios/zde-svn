  My project proposal is for an XCB Objective-C language binding.  Its main focus would be to wrap the XCB API around an Object-Oriented abstraction so that Objective-C programs could use XCB more easily.  Although Objective-C can call C functions directly, so no low-level wrapping is needed, the high-level wrapping of XCB concepts into an Object-Oriented system will prove challenging.  I have prepared a sample implementation of some of the basics, such as Connecting to the X server and creating and mapping a window.  So far, I feel that I have made good progress, but I have hit a few problems, such as how to best abstract the event system, and how much of the abstracted-away XCB structures to make available.  The sample implementation has given me a good feel for XCB, the XCB API, and how it works, since I was unfamiliar with it before, and what I will be up against as I countinue on the project.  I intend for the finished product to make available all of the core XCB API by completing the sample code, have an exhaustive test application, and have documentation generated by Doxygen.  
  
  Right now the sample implementation is available on berlios at http://svn.berlios.de/viewcvs/zde/trunk/obj-xcb/  I have a personal website at http://thisnukes4u.net which I would update at least weekly as a sort of progress journal, and I would be available on IRC during the week.  I am of course willing to accomodate any changes/suggestions/comments that you would make to this proposal.  I know that it will be a challenge to complete all of this in the little time that is allotted, but I feel that I am up to the challenge.
