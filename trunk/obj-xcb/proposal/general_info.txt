I am an eighteen year old student who will graduate from High School on June 3rd and begin attending New Mexico Tech(http://www.nmt.edu) in August.  I have taken Computer Science classes all four years of High School, and have been working on my own software projects for almost all of that time, ranging from the trivial to some more complex undertakings.  I know five different programming languages, C, C++, Objective-C, Perl , and Java, three of which I taught myself.  You should choose me for this project because I have the dedication, knowledge, and the passion to complete it.
