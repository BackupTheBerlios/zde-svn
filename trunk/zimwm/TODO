These are all rough approximations of things that need to be done to zimwm, in no particular order.
If there are parenthesis after an item, that means that something needs updating/fixing first before
the item can be completed.

*Use ZLabel's get text extents function (zwl)
 -0% done
 
*Define a new widget to place in frame on edges that can be used to trigger resizing on clicking it.
 -100% done, but I didn't need a new widget.

*Fix Resizing window
 -95% done, just need the icccm and ewmh stuff in it so it works better and smoother.

*Focus system
 -50% done, right now its just sloppy focus. I also want just pointer focus, i.e. focus is strictly is under the mouse.

*Snap window borders while moving
 -100% done
 
*Keybindings
 -5% done. So far, pressing ALT on a window and clicking moves it. There needs to be a sophisticated key:action
 configuration stored in a file, and a better subsystem to describe and implement this.
 
*Maximise windows, horizontally, vertically, or both
 -0% done

*Tile windows
 -0% done

*"Smart" window placement, i.e. where there is no window and closest to mouse pointer
 -0% done

*Titlebar buttons for Maximise, tile, other functions.  Should be images. (zwl?)
 -0% done
 
*Fix windows resizing themselves.  Not sure how to do this yet.
 -0% done

*EWMH/ICCCM Support
 -10% done

*Virtual Desktops, including keybindings and edge flipping by border
 -0%

*Various window states, i.e. sticky, withdrawn, shaded...
 -5% done
 
*IPC
 -0% I have a rough makeup of what it should be in my head.

*Speedups, especially when mapping windows. (imp,zwl)
 -0% I'm not even thinking of optimizing right now.

*Some kind of functionality to "remember" window settings, like place, size, etc. that are set/can be set by the window manager.
