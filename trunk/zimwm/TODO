These are all rough approximations of things that need to be done to zimwm, in no particular order, except for when I put them in order.
If there are parenthesis after an item, that means that something needs updating/fixing first before
the item can be completed.

**FIRST THINGS FIRST (REWRITE)**
--------------------------------
-Core stuff, initialization, etc.
-Module interface
	-This time I plan on A LOT more of zimwm's functionality being in modules, so I NEED to make sure that I do this right.

Everything else
---------------
*Update COMPLIANCE file as needed

*Focus system

*Keybindings
 
*Maximise windows, horizontally, vertically, or both

*Tile windows

*"Smart" window placement, i.e. where there is no window and closest to mouse pointer

*Titlebar buttons for Maximise, tile, other functions.  Should be images. (zwl?)
 
*Window context menu for functions and settings related to the window, anything not on the titlebar.(zwl ZMenu)
 
*Fix windows resizing themselves.

*Shaped window support
 
*EWMH/ICCCM Support

*Virtual Desktops, including keybindings and edge flipping by border
Outline of Implementation(**** This needs to be revised since the rewrite ****):
-Each desktop can have multiple virtual "workspaces". Workspaces are the visible area of the screen.  Desktops have seperate backgrounds,
and maybe even different configurations.  There can be multiple desktops arranged vertically. workspaces are arranged horizontally.
Workspaces will be implemented as extensions of the coordinate space of the first workspace of that desktop.
I am not yet sure if I want Desktops to be implemented with Virtual Roots or just extensions of the coordinate space that are arranged
horizontally.  That would be simpler, but would allow less flexibility.

*Various window states, i.e. sticky, withdrawn, shaded...
 
*IPC for remote programs to have access to zimwm runtime information and configuration settings.

*Module interface for more advanced functions than IPC, such as a Composite manager, additional behaviors.

*Speedups, especially when mapping windows. (imp,zwl)

*Fix all the stupid little bugs and memory leaks lying around

*Find all FIXMEs and XXXs and fix them.

*Some kind of functionality to "remember" window settings, like place, size, etc. that are set/can be set by the window manager.

*Convert to XCB (pending zwl conversion)

*IPC Command to find all windows and what workspace/desktop they are on by name/id/etc.
