zimwm is the window manager of the zde project.  Planned features include vi and emacs style keybindings, a command-line interface with shell-like capabilities to control zimwm in real time, and dynamically-generated menus and thumbnails for iconified windows and the pager.  This means using new technologies such as XRender, DBUS, and the freedesktop.org standards in order to provide the best possible experience.


Inspiration was obtained from (in no particular order) Ion, lwm,
Enlightenment DR16 and DR17, ratpoison, awm, waimea, ewm, failsafewm, heliwm,
jwm, mosquito, nwm, pawm, phluid, swm, uwm, wmii, pekwm, xswm, fluxbox,
openbox, any other box, sawfish, metacity, kwin, xfwm4, twm, icewm, and fvwm.
I tried really hard to like you guys, but you all fell short in at least one
critical area.  But don't worry, I'm stealing some of your best ideas and
combining them with my own into zimwm :)
